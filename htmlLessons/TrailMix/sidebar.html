                    <li>Both Hadley Fruit Orchards and Harmony Foods (two California growers) claim that trail mix was first invented in 1968 by two California surfers who blended peanuts and raisins together for an energy snack</li>
                    <li>But if weight loss is a goal, trail mix isn't the ideal snack option. Although nuts are packed with heart healthy fats, they're also pretty high in calories. So unless they're used as fuel while foraging in the forest, there are other lower calorie snacks better suited for a less active lifestyle.</li>
                    <li>Trail mix has been eaten by Native Americans for thousands of years, and originally included buffalo meat.</li>
                    <li>The combination of nuts, raisins and chocolate as a trail snack dates at least to the 1910s, when outdoorsman Horace Kephart recommended it in his popular camping guide.</li>
                    <li>In Australia and New Zealand they call trail mix Scroggin.</li>
                    <li>Trail mix is also called GORP (Good Old Raisins and Peanuts or Granola, Oats, Raisins, and Peanuts)</li>
