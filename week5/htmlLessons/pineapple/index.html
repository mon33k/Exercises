        <h1>Benefits of Pineapples!!</h1>
        <p>Doesn’t the mere mention of pineapples remind you of 
            Spongebob Squarepants? With its tuft of spiky, dusty 
            green leaves, and cross-hatched, golden orange skin, 
            the pineapple is spiny from the outside and sweet on 
            the inside. It’s tangy and awesome, just like I like 
            it. So, whether it’s about making a fruit salad or 
            choosing an ice-lolly flavor, pineapples are most 
            definitely on my list of choices (sometimes, the 
            favorable too). We all know that this ‘Hawaii’-track 
            fruit is called ‘Ananas‘ in Hindi, but did we know that 
            it’s also called ‘Anasa Pandu‘ in Telugu, ‘Anasi Pazham‘ 
            in Tamil, ‘Kayita Chakka‘ in Malayalam, and ‘Anarosh‘ in 
            Bengali? I’m sure all of you get lured by its appearance, 
            which makes it the most favorable choice in summer prints. 
            Don’t most of us own a distinct variation of ‘pineapple print’ 
            T-shirt or shorts? Let me enlighten you with a fact that not 
            many of us know – a single pineapple is, in fact, a collection 
            of multiple fruits; each one is the fruit of an individual 
            blossom. Surprised? Well, it’s exotic and tropical in its own way!
